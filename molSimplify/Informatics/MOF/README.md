A user can generate RAC features for a MOF using [`MOF_descriptors.py`](MOF_descriptors.py), provided the user has a CIF file for the MOF in question. The main function is `get_MOF_descriptors`. An example is provided at the end of the python file.

A user can add functional groups to a CIF file using [`MOF_functionalizer.py`](MOF_functionalizer.py) which supports functionalization with 12 common functional groups. The main functions are `functionalize_MOF` and `functionalize_MOF_at_indices`. An example is provided at the end of the python file. The supported functional groups are indicated in the function `check_support`. A user can add support for an additional functional group by adding an XYZ to the folder [`monofunctionalized_BDC`](monofunctionalized_BDC) and adding an entry to [`index_information.py`](monofunctionalized_BDC/index_information.py). Custom functional groups can be used with the function `functionalize_MOF_at_indices`.

A users can also use an updated version of the functionalization code [`MOF_functionalizer_v2.py`] that supports functionalization with additional 19 functional groups, along with the 12 functional groups supported in the previous version. Unlike the previous version, this code supports functionalization with bulky functional groups (e.g., acetamide, pyrrole) and perform rotations of functional groups to avoid atomic overlap. The newer version is little slower than the earlier version. Like the previos version, the supported functional groups are indicated in the function `check_support`. A user can add support for an additional functional group by adding the symbols of the functional group atoms, positions of the function group atoms placed on a benzene molecule, position of the functionalized carbon atom on the benzene molecule connected to the functional group, and one of the neighboring carbon atoms that are one bond away from the functionalized carbon atom to the file ['functional_group_dictionary.pkl']. Custom functional groups can be used with the function `functionalize_MOF_at_indices`.
